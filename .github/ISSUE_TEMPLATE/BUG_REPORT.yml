        ## üìã Minimal reproduction
        > ‚ö†Ô∏è If a minimal reproduction is not provided, **the issue will be closed.**

        The minimal reproduction proves a bug exists in this project, streamlines the conversation, and allows others to debug it for you right away.

        #### Requirements
        1. Create the reproduction on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) or a new GitHub repository so it can be opened in the browser.
        2. Keep the reproduction small.
          Delete _everything_ you don't need. Narrowing the scope is the first step of debugging so doing this will save us work.
          The _smaller_ the reproduction, the _faster_ we can debug and resolve your issue.

        3. No more than 10 files.
          Delete irrelevant files (e.g. `LICENSE`, `.npmrc`, `.github`).
        4. Set the `start` script in `package.json` to the command that demonstrates the bug.
